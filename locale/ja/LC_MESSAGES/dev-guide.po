msgstr ""

#: ../../PVGeo/docs/source/dev-guide/repo-structure.rst:8
msgid ""
"In developing the *PVGeo* repository, we decided to follow a framework of "
"development that generates various sets of tools that can be used within "
"ParaView or outside in other Python environments with the VTK Python "
"library. This would allow for users of *PVGeo* to be able to use all of the "
"functionality as plugins in ParaView with interactive user menus or outside "
"of ParaView be able to integrate with there existing data processing suites "
"using Python and VTK. This development framework also focuses heavily on the"
" open source paradigm in that *PVGeo* contains many base classes for "
"developers to inherit functionality to aid in the development of new "
"features. Unfortunately, the development of plugins for the ParaView "
"software platform may imply an ambitious programming endeavor, including "
"creating CMakeLists, developing in lower level programming languages like "
"C++, learning new libraries to create interactive GUI components, and "
"building the plugins into the ParaView source code. However, the *PVGeo* "
"module takes advantage of functionality by Kitware that facilitates the "
"rapid development of readers, sources, filters, and writers: instantiations "
"of the ``VTKPythonAlgorithmBase`` class in Python. Python is an accessible "
"language, easy to learn, and popular among geoscientists using packages "
"like: SimPEG, ObsPy, EarthPy, pyFLOWGO, GeoNotebook, and more. We choose to "
"develop the *PVGeo* library to work well with other Python libraries by "
"following the following framework:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../PVGeo/docs/source/dev-guide/repo-structure.rst:29
msgid ""
"**Extendable:** This software will harness the established and robust "
"visualization platforms ParaView and VTK, extend their functionality, and "
"remain open-source for contributions and integration into other Python "
"powered geoscientific processing suites."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PVGeo/docs/source/dev-guide/repo-structure.rst:30
msgid "**Safe:** The software must preserve data integrity and precision."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PVGeo/docs/source/dev-guide/repo-structure.rst:31
msgid ""
"**Dynamic:** The software must enable a dynamic link between external "
"processing software and visualization libraries."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PVGeo/docs/source/dev-guide/repo-structure.rst:32
msgid ""
"**Modular:** The software will be modular so that various visualization "
"suites can be implemented separately but also work together. This software "
"should be usable both within and outside of ParaView."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PVGeo/docs/source/dev-guide/repo-structure.rst:33
msgid ""
"**Rapid development:** Through further subclasses of the "
"``VTKPythonAlgorithmBase`` class and the templates in *PVGeo*, it is easy to"
" prototype and develop a plugin in a matter of minutes without the need to "
"rebuild the software."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PVGeo/docs/source/dev-guide/repo-structure.rst:34

"Python's complex numerical analysis libraries like SciPy and NumPy."
msgstr ""

"**Easy customization by end user:** since most geoscientists know and use "

"Develop and document geoscientific plugins for ParaView encompassed in "
"various suites. Each suite of plugins will be tailored to specific data "
"formats and/or processing needs in geoscience. These plugins will take "
"advantage of ParaView and VTK’s Python wrapping and use the Python "
"Programmable Filter in ParaView. The advantage to using Python Programmable "
"filters is that they are easily modified by the end user and can be wrapped "
"in XML to create a GUI for its use in ParaView while having the option to "
"directly edit the source code live in ParaView. The suites of plugins will "
"consist of the following plugin types:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../PVGeo/docs/source/dev-guide/repo-structure.rst:45
msgid ""
"**Readers:** A reader puts data from files into proper ParaView data "
"structures on the pipeline. These are plugins that read common geoscientific"
" and geophysical spatial data files (GSLIB, UBC Tensor and OcTree meshes, "
"etc.). Also make readers that read common raw data files (packed binary "
"floats, delimited ASCII, etc.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../PVGeo/docs/source/dev-guide/repo-structure.rst:47
msgid ""
"**Filters:** A filter modifies, transforms, combines, analyses, etc. data on"
" the ParaView pipeline. Plugins that perform post-processing analysis of "
"geoscientific data for visualization. For example, filters that build tubes "
"from a series of points that represent a tunnel or filters that take a 1D "
"array, reshape it to 2D or 3D, and make a volumetric model ready for "
"visualization all while adding spatial reference for visual integration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../PVGeo/docs/source/dev-guide/repo-structure.rst:49
msgid ""
"**Sources:** Plugins that create simple synthetic data sources that could be"
" used for model generation. We are creating a suite of plugins for "
"generating various types of discretized models/meshes which can be exported."
" Another example could include a sphere or cube with a specified attribute "
"like a spatially varying density or electrical conductivity. Other sources "
"might include using that synthetic sphere or cube to make a volumetric field"
" of some response. These plugins will tailor to the educational needs in "
"applications of this code base."
